ABI soft tissue instumentation group
A shared repository for various code and projects associated with image reconstruction, image tracking, and machine vision.

Housekeeping
Although we will be working on some disparite things initially, these will eventually be integrated together - requiring multiple people working in the same areas of the repository simultaneously. To minimise issues down the line, we should aim to use this repository in the way that we would ideally need to in the future - conditioning ourselves now so we are ready when it matters.

So here are a few rules:

Everyone works on a seperate branch.
Merging back to a common branch (e.g. master branch) is done via pull request.
Push to the repository frequently when making changes - or at least at the end of the day.
Don't add large volumes of data to the repository (use the file cloud instead).
Lastly, a bit of advice as we have people with varying experience using version control - make commits frequently, after each feature change if possible. One of the most powerful abilities of version control is that checkpoints your code with every commit, enabling you to revisit what your code was at any of these checkpoints.

And remember - always Pull before you Push, and always merge the target branch into yours before making a pull request.

Resources
I've added a few useful documents to the Resources folder:

Git Cheatsheet + Introductory Slides (from a workshop I attended a few years back)
Markdown Cheatsheet for making readme files like this :-)
Conda 4.6 Cheatsheet for those of us using python
